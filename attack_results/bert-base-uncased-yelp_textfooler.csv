We have done an annual man-cation here for the last 4 years in July and  I don't have a single [[complaint]] and below are a couple reasons why.  I do understand the Flamingo can be a little difficult to navigate and in some aspects has kind of turned into a In and Out Burger type establishment where you need to know the secret menu but here is your secret menu:\n\n1.  This is the FLAMINGO so you are already setting yourself up for failure if you go in expecting the Wynn or some other fancy hotel I have only seen the outside of.  Wrap your head around that before booking at this hotel.  I am not someone who subscribes to the theory of just getting a crap hotel because you are never in it.  I want a good bed and nice shower even if I do plan on being in the room 6 hours over the course of 3 days.  You can still get a quality room at the Flamingo if you know what you are doing\n\n2.  BOOKING A [[ROOM]]:\nWhen you get a room spend the extra money and get a Go Room.  Don't pay for the upgrade for the rooms with the crap fake wood floor.  A Go Room I say.  Don't pay for a suite unless you are already in a gambling mood.  Some can be great and others can look like an apartment circa 1972.  Getting a standard room is like asking for your room to smell of cat urine and vomit.  Again if you are in the gambling mood give it a whirl.  The Go Rooms are clean for the most part and modern.  Good shower and bed with an I pod docking station for listening to good jams before you go out.\n\n3.  CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a cluster mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.

Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.  Still plenty of good looking people.  Hope this helps","Successful"

High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.\n\nSecondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a [[digit]].\n\nRecession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a [[bargain]].\n\nThirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.\n\nFourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.\n\nEven ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.\n\nOther reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal). After reading the reviews on Yelp, heading over there for the vouchers can actually offset the sales taxes (10%).

High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.\n\nSecondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a [[numeric]].\n\nRecession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a [[dealings]].\n\nThirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.\n\nFourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.\n\nEven ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.\n\nOther reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal).

I got the hair cut! She offered me products and I bought one! But the color stayed the same from when I came in.

I usually get the Apache Roll, under different circumstances. The Apache roll is basically a California roll with spicy mayo on top, white fish on top and baked. So, I asked if they could make me a California roll, but put the spicy mayo on top and bake it for me. Keep in mind, Sushi Kee does this for me EVERY TIME I GO. The waiter told me they couldn't do that but they could substitute the fish. So, I ok'd and just asked to put shrimp on top instead. Well, 20 minutes later, he comes out with two California rolls, the way I requested, but with [[NO]] fish on top what so ever. Mind you, I asked for ONE regular California roll and ONE Apache style. It bothered me that he didn't even come out and tell me that they weren't going to substitute the fish AND the fact that he didn't check my order. So, I got charged FULL price for 2 Apache rolls. When, in fact, they were not Apache rolls. When confronted about it he said, \""""well, we would have to charge you 3$ anyway for the spicy mayo and to bake it so i figured I would just charge you the full price for the Apache.\"""" How does this make sense? A California roll is 4$ maybe 5$? and an Apache is almost 10$. ANYWAY, he did not care what so ever. Oh and when we were bone dry on our drinks, we look over, and he's sitting at the end of the bar just watching some TV. It took him a good 7 minutes to come back to the table to check on us. Needless to say, I have never tipped that horrible, EVER.\n\nA different friend of mine and I decided to go again. We both live so close so it's convenient. The waitress was wearing this TINY little skirt. Literally, you could see things when she walked away from the table. About the service she gave, it was way better than anyone else working there! Touche to her! However, the food ... eh okay. Now when I go to Zushi I don't EVER ask for any type of specialty rolls because they have made it clear, they don't understand.

It's pretty tasty of a combination, though I was unsure of the creaminess at first. \n*seafood toastada- this was tasty with a bit spicy and sweet sauce, chopped fish on a crispy wonton.

We kept ordering this, the favorite of the night.\n*red snapper- I normally don't like this, but I go back to try once in a while. Here it was rather fresh and enjoyable. \n*scallop- Whole scallop nigiri is one of my favorites. We normally ask in our favorite spot for masago/tobiko on top and a squeeze of yuzu sauce. The scallop was fresh and sweet here, but their yuzu sauce is rather sweet than citrus so I don't know if it has yuzu at all. Iwould order without and maybe do a touch of lemon next time. I generally lean towards tangy flavors than sweet when it comes to sushi.\n*mackerel- One of my favorite things to order, here it was just okay. It was a bit stronger flavor and salty than I would like. \n*uni - Theirs was fresh and sweet! It's a recent acquired taste I'm liking more and more, so I'm sensitive to when it's not fresh and very iodine tasting. I like theirs a lot. \n\nROLL\n*Denver roll - We got this based on it having soft shell crab so I was kinda expecting it to be like a spider roll, with a big crab in it, this had more of it sliced then fried. It was alright, I like the crunch with the shrimp on top and the crab mix. I'm not a roll person normally, but I appreciate their rice ratio in rolls is rather fair. \n*salmon skin handroll- Unlike some places where the skin has a bit a meat, this is pure skin goodness. It makes for a really chip like crisp to it. Theirs has the usual sprouts, cucumber and gobo root, but one thing I've never had is this was also wrapped with some shiso/ perilla leaf in it!

So in fact besides the $10 corking fee which was understood, the $45 paid for the wine was not a discounted price, but in fact a regular price.\n\nThe service here is incredibly personable. Osvoldo was a fantastic and attentive server. The owner Dennis, even came to our table to greet us near the end of our meal, and sent over some complimentary dessert.\n\nThe food was so divine though, I ordered the Pesto Gnocchi topped with melted mozzarella, which was thick and creamy.

[[FIVE]] HUNNIDD. 5 hundred [[ones]].\n\[[nOn]] my 2nd [[trip]] back to [[Vegas]] in as [[many]] weeks, I just had to have more of Bachi Burger. I met a grade school classmate who lives in town at the original location on Windmill. It was my first time at this location. It was just a little after 11am on a Friday. I had just landed at McCarran. From the airport, I got my rental car and drove the short distance to Bachi. I was seated right away being that they just opened. I was seated towards the back by the window on the way to the restrooms but still had full view of  the [[entire]] restaurant. \n\nWaited a little while for my friend as she was in transit but stuck in traffic. The waiter we had made sure to check on me a couple of times and I started off with the oxtail cheese fries. It was served just in time as my friend sat down. Great timing!.. The oxtail chili cheese fries were as good as I remember. Perfectly crisp fries, tender strips of oxtail strewn about amongst cheese, chili (with beans), jalapeno slices & cilantro. Oh and dont forget the fried egg on top... Good stuff.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the pork belly steamed buns (3 pieces) instead of a burger. It's just so tasty and perfect in its bite sized form. The soft & delicious still warm steamed bun, cradling the slightly crisp on the edges but buttery soft pork belly with hoisin sauce, sliced hard boiled egg & cilantro (i dont even like cilantro!) combination is so damn good. Its one of my most favorite cravings these days. Thankfully the Sawtelle location opened the same exact day I was at the OG location. I'm definitely going there to get my fix and to support my friend's cousin who is a line cook there. \n\nMy friend ordered the Miyagi-san burger with furikake, fried egg, chili mayonnaise, honey bacon and onion rings. It was good but the patty was overcooked to well done as my friend specifically ordered it medium-well. I also found it to be super sticky eating. Even the bun was kind of sticky. It could have been better.\n\nService was good, attentive. I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows I was sitting at needed some dusting and I didnt like seeing a couple of flies buzzing by the window blinds. Parking was plentiful because its in a shared lot with several other businesses. Bachi gets full in a hurry. Within a half hour of me being seated (11:15am) the place was packed...Shoku Ramen's (formerly next door) menu is served at Bachi Burger now, so the paper signs say.

[[VS]] HUNNIDD. 5 hundred [[persons]].\n\[[nope]] my 2nd [[passenger]] back to [[Nevada]] in as [[varying]] weeks, I just had to have more of Bachi Burger. I met a grade school classmate who lives in town at the original location on Windmill. It was my first time at this location. It was just a little after 11am on a Friday. I had just landed at McCarran. From the airport, I got my rental car and drove the short distance to Bachi. I was seated right away being that they just opened. I was seated towards the back by the window on the way to the restrooms but still had full view of  the [[utter]] restaurant. \n\nWaited a little while for my friend as she was in transit but stuck in traffic. The waiter we had made sure to check on me a couple of times and I started off with the oxtail cheese fries. It was served just in time as my friend sat down. Great timing!.. The oxtail chili cheese fries were as good as I remember. Perfectly crisp fries, tender strips of oxtail strewn about amongst cheese, chili (with beans), jalapeno slices & cilantro. Oh and dont forget the fried egg on top... Good stuff.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the pork belly steamed buns (3 pieces) instead of a burger. It's just so tasty and perfect in its bite sized form. The soft & delicious still warm steamed bun, cradling the slightly crisp on the edges but buttery soft pork belly with hoisin sauce, sliced hard boiled egg & cilantro (i dont even like cilantro!) combination is so damn good. Its one of my most favorite cravings these days. Thankfully the Sawtelle location opened the same exact day I was at the OG location. I'm definitely going there to get my fix and to support my friend's cousin who is a line cook there. \n\nMy friend ordered the Miyagi-san burger with furikake, fried egg, chili mayonnaise, honey bacon and onion rings. It was good but the patty was overcooked to well done as my friend specifically ordered it medium-well. I also found it to be super sticky eating. Even the bun was kind of sticky. It could have been better.\n\nService was good, attentive. I thought the place could be a little cleaner. The windows I was sitting at needed some dusting and I didnt like seeing a couple of flies buzzing by the window blinds. Parking was plentiful because its in a shared lot with several other businesses. Bachi gets full in a hurry. Within a half hour of me being seated (11:15am) the place was packed...Shoku Ramen's (formerly next door) menu is served at Bachi Burger now, so the paper signs say. Thank you Bachi Burger but I think I like the Summerlin location better. You know what they say about first loves... They  never die. And Summerlin won me over at first bite.","Successful"

[[Inga]] [[meet]] no [[calling]] back... WTF is going on here... I finally get a hold of someone (dialing there number 10 times in an hour) who says (I think she said she was the owner) we aren't taking anymore appointments until after the 18th, after the Groupon ends HAHA! I was stunned I said, that isnt fair and explained Ive left messages you never answer your phone how am I suppose to get in? She said well \""""We left a voicemail on our phone stating we had the flu (really the flu)and are short handed!\"""" Ok #1 I NEVER heard that once in all of my calls #2 HOW is that my problem? I explained that my Groupon was ending and she said \""""Like hundreds of other people in your situation\"""" WHAT really? She just said this as the owner. I asked well if thats the case then you should extend the offer. She said IF I extend the offer I will never make any money at this. I told her Maybe instead of doing two different promos she should have only done one. I said I usually go to Dolce and wanted to try something new, She replied well you wont be a repeat customer so I dont care anyways... (Like she knew she couldn't live up to Dolce's customer service and pedi HAHA)\nThen she said just call Groupon and get your money back, they have a no ask policy and will refund you, I cant help you. They are the one who OVER SOLD the Groupon and its there fault anyways. Im thinking YOU did Living Social and Groupon in TWO days and only allowed 6 months to get all your thousands of customers done. \n I hope that Groupon never allows that company to again post a special from all of the negative reviews and many peoples experience with this weird place. After reading the many reviews about the tin can, ripped couches GROSS, long nails and horrible scrubs, I AM SOOOO GLAD that I called Groupon and got my money back. I would advise EVERYONE to do the same. Groupon did say they had quite a few calls about this place, and they were sorry that their customers had to deal with the service they have been giving. THANK GOD I purchased this from Groupon and received a full refund on both purchased!!!\nSorry so winded, but this company was just a complete ZERO!","Successful"

Let me say that this was the finest edamame that I've ever tasted.  Most edamame is overcooked into mush -- but not at Bachi.  Bachi's edamame is crunchy, fresh, and delicious.  The ginger was delightful, and the chili sauce provided a level of spice that was intense but not overpowering.\n\nService was fantastic.  My server, Kelly, moved quickly and efficiently -- always making sure that I was happily taken care of.  Even the prices are fair, since you're not dealing with the up-charges that are more typical of Strip restaurants.\n\nI can't wait to try Bachi's delicious delights again.

You [[arrives]] a one [[sauce]] [[slice]] for 5 dollars and they do not differentiate between what is a premium [[substance]] or not. For example, you can get a feta cheese pizza for the same price as a pepperoni. In the beginning the crust was a little inconsistent but now that they have gotten into a groove it is my go to place for a late night za.","Successful"

I don't know if the rice plates are good, but the spring rolls are decent too.  \n\nSo if u are in chandler and craving pho, u know where to go :)  let me know if u know of any place better, i am always interested to try ;)","Skipped"

(Plus their website photos are [[impressive]] - with their cute little [[female]] [[ascribe]] in them.)","Successful"
